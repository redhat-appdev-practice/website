## What Are The Runtimes?

At [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) we support a few popular development runtimes and frameworks as part of our "Red Hat Runtimes" and "AppStream" products. Between these two products, Red Hat provides commercial support for the following programming languages and frameworks:

* Supersonic, SubAtomic Java and GraalVM via [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/)
* Low-Latency, High Throughput, Reactive Programming via [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/)
* Server-Side and Client-Side JavaScript and TypeScript via [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
* Traditional Spring and SpringBoot Development via [Snowdrop](https://snowdrop.me/)
* [EE Microprofile](https://microprofile.io/) via [Thorntail](https://thorntail.io/)
* [JakartaEE/JavaEE](https://jakarta.ee/) via [JBoss Enterprise Application Server](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform)

## What Can I Learn Here?

While there are a great number of resources for each of these runtimes elsewhere on the Internet, what we have been trying to curate in this content is an opinionated, efficient, design-first, cloud-native application development methodology. For each Runtime listed above, we expect to have content to assist with each of the following aspects:

* Contract-First Development with OpenAPI & OpenAPI Generator
* REST APIs
* Integration With [KeyCloak or Red Hat SSO](https://www.keycloak.org/) for Authentication
* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing With Behavior Driven Development
* Database Access
* Feature Flags
* Secure Coding Practices
* Configuration Management In Kubernetes/OpenShift
* Logging Best Practices
* Distributed Tracing
* Performance Monitoring
